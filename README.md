# inventory-management-prediction
machine learning model for selling aging products which have been lying in an inventory for more than 30 days and predicting another logistic where it may sell faster.  

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


The predictions will be made keeping 3 factors in ptice - 1) price (premiumness)
                                                          2) location
                                                          3) logistics rating
                                                          
                                                          
The criteria for aging has been set to 90 days but that may be changed later anytime .

the model ustilizes artifical neural network(ANN)
